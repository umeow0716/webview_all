* Avoid injecting console and scroll JavaScript hooks until their callbacks are enabled.
* Add opt-in raw request/response capture with lazy asynchronous response-body access.
* Mark Linux captured request headers as provisional because WebKitGTK reports them before NetworkProcess/libsoup finalization.

* Add deterministic Windows WebView2 cleanup through `WindowsWebViewController.dispose()`, including safe disposal during initialization and automatic fallback cleanup.

## 1.3.6

* Fix Linux system input routing so WebKitGTK receives pointer, keyboard, and wheel input without disabling Flutter controls or allowing clicks to pass through the application window.
* Keep Linux native WebView position and visibility correct across HiDPI displays, viewport edges, controller changes, application lifecycle changes, and when enclosing Flutter widgets are hidden or leave the visible area.
* Improve Linux `GtkOverlay` layout and cleanup, prevent older position updates from overriding current state, and safely hide the WebView for transforms that GTK cannot display accurately.

## 1.3.5

* Refine documentation details.

## 1.3.4

* Apply Linux media gesture settings to modern WebKitGTK autoplay policies and reliably open page-requested windows in the current WebView.
* Apply Windows navigation decisions to page-initiated main-frame loads and same-window popups while preserving controller request methods, headers, and bodies.
* Isolate Windows local files and assets behind private per-controller hosts, reject unsafe paths, clear stale mappings, and improve WebView2 decision and download callback reliability.
* Preserve exact binary response bytes and final redirect URLs on Web, and bound retained response history by both entry count and total size.
* Complete OHOS bridge object release handshakes and safely finish stale permission, authentication, dialog, and custom-view callbacks instead of leaking or crashing.
* Contain Android and OHOS navigation callback failures, harden JavaScript channel names on supported platforms, and reject unsafe Linux file and asset paths.
* Keep Windows native builds on C++17 without imposing C++20 or legacy coroutine flags on applications.

* Prevent an older concurrent Web request from replacing a newer navigation and limit controller-managed history to 100 entries.
* Improve Web cookie safety and accuracy by rejecting foreign-domain writes, restricting reads to the current document context, clearing visible cookie paths more thoroughly, and tolerating malformed encoded values.
* Prevent Linux navigation, authentication, TLS, permission, and JavaScript dialog callbacks from indefinitely blocking the WebView when an application callback fails or does not complete.
* Improve Android cookie parsing for encoded names, values containing `=`, and malformed encoded values, improve native WebView access from Android host code, and support both legacy and Built-in Kotlin Android builds.
* Improve iOS WebView cleanup when an application terminates, a scene disconnects, or the Flutter engine detaches, and add native `WKWebView` lookup from a `FlutterPluginRegistrar`.
* Tolerate encoded names and malformed encoded cookie values on OHOS, and add an isolated OHOS Flutter command helper that does not alter the stock Flutter package configuration.
* Update the Web implementation to use `web 1.1.1`.

## 1.3.1

* Make macOS capabilities version-aware: use native background color and magnification APIs where available, fall back to older JavaScript preferences, and log safe no-ops for WebKit features with no public macOS API.
* Keep fetch-backed and strictly sandboxed Web HTML in opaque origins while restoring supported controller features through a source-validated, navigation-scoped message bridge; harden content-type decoding and synchronous dialog fallbacks.
* Enforce Linux `enableZoom`, reject Android POST requests whose custom headers cannot be preserved, and safely handle future Android file chooser modes.
* Serialize OHOS file-access setup before local loads and propagate native ArkWeb load failures instead of reporting false success.
* Convert Windows WebView2 environment, texture, and capture initialization failures into diagnosable platform errors instead of native assertion crashes.

## 1.3.0

* Use weak-reference callbacks and finalizer-based automatic cleanup so built-in Windows, Linux, and Web controllers release platform resources after becoming unreachable; OHOS continues to use its existing instance-manager lifecycle.
* The Linux plugin installs the GTK overlay automatically, so runner source changes are no longer required.

## 1.2.1

* Ignore `setBackgroundColor` on macOS and log the skipped call, avoiding application exceptions caused by unimplemented WKWebView `opaque` / `backgroundColor`.

## 1.2.0

* Complete `webview_flutter_platform_interface` coverage across the federated platform packages.
* Add Linux WebKitGTK-specific controller creation parameters and runtime settings for developer extras, JavaScript window opening, media playback, page cache, file URL access, text zoom/font sizing, page zoom, and DevTools opening.
* Add Web iframe-specific creation parameters and runtime attribute setters for `allow`, `sandbox`, `referrerpolicy`, and custom iframe attributes while preserving custom sandbox values across JavaScript mode changes.
* Add OHOS ArkWeb-specific controller creation parameters and runtime WebSettings setters for DOM storage, JavaScript window opening, multiple windows, viewport/overview mode, zoom controls, file access, media gesture policy, support zoom, text zoom, and full-screen rotation.
* Add explicit cross-platform `loadFileWithParams` controller overrides.
* Return `null` for platform SSL auth error certificates when the native platform does not provide certificate data.
* Validate generic WebView cookies before forwarding them to platform cookie stores.
* Avoid replaying OHOS sub-frame navigation requests as main-frame loads after navigation delegate approval.
* Include platform-specific request metadata and response details when reporting HTTP status errors where available.
* Decode OHOS JavaScript evaluation results through JSON so strings, arrays, objects, booleans, and numbers match the structured result behavior of the other platforms where possible.
* Make OHOS POST `loadRequest` calls with custom headers fail explicitly instead of silently dropping headers, and document the ArkWeb limitation.
* Return the default WebView2 permission decision for unsupported Windows permission kinds instead of surfacing empty resource requests to applications.
* Deny Linux permission requests that contain no recognized resource types instead of surfacing empty resource requests to applications.
* Add main wrapper forwarding tests for `WebViewController`, `NavigationDelegate`, permission requests, and `WebViewWidget`.
* Add shared analyzer lint configuration for the main and federated platform packages.
* Add `examples/platform` to local validation and audit its path package lockfile versions against the workspace release version.

* Remove a Web JavaScript dialog bridge runtime type check that triggered Flutter Web wasm dry-run warnings, and add multi-WebView dialog bridge coverage.
* Add Windows and Linux request body/header handling and HTTP status error coverage for `loadRequest`.
* Add Windows and Linux native local storage clearing.
* Complete OHOS HTTP error and SSL auth callback bridging.
* Harden the Web implementation with same-origin JavaScript execution, JavaScript channels, console forwarding, alert/confirm/prompt forwarding, scrolling, scrollbars, over-scroll, JavaScript mode, zoom, and permission request coverage where browsers allow it.
* Add an explicit Web `PlatformSslAuthError` implementation that reports unsupported recoverable certificate decisions instead of leaving the platform interface methods missing.
* Add `WebWebViewWidgetCreationParams` so the Web platform matches the platform-specific widget creation-params pattern used by other federated packages.

## 1.1.2

* Align `WebViewCookieManager.getCookies({required Uri domain})` with the upstream `webview_flutter` public API.

## 1.1.1

* Update the example app to use `abutil` for platform detection.
* Simplify the example app's OHOS and Web platform branches.
* Synchronize platform package license files with the main package license.

## 1.1.0

* Add OpenHarmony platform implementation support.
* Improve cookie API coverage:
  * Add the common `WebViewCookieManager.getCookies({required Uri domain})` API to the main plugin wrapper.
  * Implement and validate cross-platform cookie reads for the federated platform packages.
  * Add Windows WebView2-specific cookie APIs for full cookie metadata and deletion workflows.
* Harden the Web platform implementation:
  * Preserve logical `currentUrl()` values for `loadHtmlString` and XHR-backed `loadRequest` calls instead of exposing internal `data:` iframe URLs.
  * Resolve Flutter web assets through the generated `assets/` directory and encode asset path segments correctly.
  * Report XHR-backed load failures through `onWebResourceError` and keep unsupported user agent overrides from being reported as applied.
  * Validate and encode browser-visible cookies before writing to `document.cookie`, and document iframe and browser cookie limitations.
* Improve the Linux platform implementation:
  * Fix native WebView visibility synchronization so a stable Flutter frame no longer collapses the GTK/WebKit view to `0x0`.
  * Harden Linux frame, cookie, and JavaScript channel inputs to avoid invalid native state and unsafe script injection.
